## The First Step in Resistance
{{< center capitals.webp>}}

Our current social problems stem from our dependence on huge capitals.
However, it is not easy to become independent from capital,
because you will suffer irrationality if you break that dependence.
So, as a first step toward independence,
why don't we develop a place where independent people can connect with each other on their own social media?

It will be achieved by the following:

1. a system that is not locked in by the platform
2. content with high information intensity

For #1, mastodon is an option.

For #2, it is a matter of user awareness. Currently, social media are causing a flood of information, filter bubbles, and excessive pursuit of approval, which are affecting individuals and society in various ways. Such problems cannot be solved by a mechanism, but require an update of people's mindset.


## Information intensity
{{< center dema.webp>}}

The world is complex.
Therefore, when we try to communicate correctly,
explanations become long and difficult to understand,
but they are not always clear-cut, or only a vague conclusion.
In the end, there is very little that can be asserted with certainty.

People are not looking for correct information.
They just want to find information to provide a reason for the conclusions they believe in and to find relief.
There is a large amount of information without intensity on social media to get superficial sympathy and sense of unity.
The catchier the information, the more demand there is for it,
so the sender responds by simplifying the conclusion or overstating it in a way that people want,
and the **information intensity** is lost.
Therefore, disinformation is a problem caused by the receivers.  

Social media can expand opportunities,
but it becomes harmful if it only keeps people on the surface.
We need spaces where those who understand the high information intensity can guide others into deeper understanding.

## Aggregation bot as membrane
If an individual were to be placed in it in isolation, one would tend to be lost in the whole because the mastodon world is already large enough.
Just as cell membranes are indispensable for organisms to grow by increasing the number of cells,
membranes of appropriate size are necessary for organisms to spread out while maintaining organic order.
Ideally, each membrane would have its own philosophy,
as philosophy is shared inside the membrane.

There is an aggregation bot to create a membrane that function in such a way.

## Client
When using Mastodon from a PC, a browser is fine.
Android users can also use Mastodon with PWA (open in the browser and add to the home screen from the menu).
Notifications also work with PWA. 
(I have notifications turned off, so I don't really know.)

## Other apps
### matrix + element(https://element.io/)
A decentralized chat app. Matrix is the protocol and element is the name of the app.  
Information protection for mastodon is inevitably left to the instance administrator. (* Most other services are left to the private company.)
The matrix protocol allows for fully encrypted communication between sender and receiver, so that even the server administrator cannot see the contents.
It is preferable to use such a tool for exchanging sensitive information.

### nextcloud(https://nextcloud.com)  
The project originally started as a file-sharing system, but it has been expanded to include chat applications, groupware, office, and many other features. If you want to use it, you need to set up your own server (a rental server that can run PHP and MySQL and has SSH available is probably fine).
